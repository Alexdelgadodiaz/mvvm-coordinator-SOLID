Step-by-step process:

Create an Xcode workspace and iOS app project.
Add the Swift packages and iOS app to that workspace.
Create a test plan file (.xctestplan) by going to File > New > File... and select 'Test Plan'.
In that test plan, add the Swift package tests (and any other tests) you'd like to execute.
In the test section of the iOS app's scheme, add the existing test plan you created.
Create an Xcode Cloud workflow as usual, targeting the test plan when adding the test action.
